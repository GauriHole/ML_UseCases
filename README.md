# ML_UseCases
Welcome to the **Machine Learning Model Use Cases** repository! This repository showcases practical examples and use cases of various machine learning algorithms. Each example is designed to help you understand, implement, and explore machine learning concepts with real-world scenarios.

# Machine Learning Algorithms :
1. **Naive Bayes**: A classification method based on Bayes' Theorem, assuming all features are independent. Each feature's presence is unrelated to others.  
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A supervised learning algorithm for classification and regression. It predicts outcomes based on the K nearest data points and is also useful for filling missing values and resampling.  
3. **Decision Tree**: A supervised algorithm for classification and regression. It uses a tree structure where internal nodes represent features, branches represent decisions, and leaves represent outcomes.
